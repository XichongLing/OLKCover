# OLKCover

The theme OST "One Last Kiss" by Utada Hikaru is fanscinating, and so is its cover. The two matlab files attempt to generate a One Last Kiss style picture from a given image, which is a tiny commemoration to the end of this lengendary series, and to many's youth as well.

The colormap.m file produces a colormap which is visually similar to that in the origin cover. And OLKCover.m employes Canny Edge detector to extract edges in the input file, later filling in the edges with colors in our defined colormap.


An example:
<div align=center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XichongLing/OLKCover/master/img/asuka.jpg" width="400" height = "375"/>
</div>
<div align = center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XichongLing/OLKCover/master/img/OLKasuka.png" width = "400" height = "375"/>
</div>
